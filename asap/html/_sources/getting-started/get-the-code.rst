The `asap` development model supports the `Fork and pull model
<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model>`_
of github projects as well as the creation of repositories from `asap` as a
template.

A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to
a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from
or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests. This will give
you total freedom to change the code after the way you want, while still keeping
the option to pull updates from the original `asap` project or to contribute
useful changes or bug fixes in the form of pull requests to the original `asap`
project.

If you want to create a new repository from the contents of an existing
repository but don't want to merge your changes to the upstream in the future,
you can duplicate the repository or, if the repository is a template, you can
use the repository as a template. For more information, see "`Duplicating a
repository <https://docs.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository>`_" and
"`Creating a repository from a template
<https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template>`_".

1. Creating your project's repository
=====================================

.. hint::
  :class: margin

  The `asap` project is located at `https://github.com/abdes/asap`.

Option 1: Fork the `asap` project
---------------------------------

Follow the instructions described in the `Fork a repo
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ documentation
of GitHub to fork the `asap` project.

.. important::

  Rename your fork to match your project name as early as possible in the
  process. Although you can do this step at any time in the future, it is
  recommended to do it immediately after the fork.

  Follow the instructions described in `Renaming a repository
  <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository>`_
  document from the GitHub documentation.

Option 2: Use `asap` as a template
==================================
Follow the instructions described in the `Creating a repository from a template
<https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template>`_
documentation of GitHub to create a new repository from the `asap` template.

2. Clone your repo
==================

.. tip::
  :class: margin

  -j4 requests git to parallelize cloning of repos. Needs a relatively recent
  version of git. If that is not available, simply do not use this option.

The `asap` project makes use of git submodules. There is a simple way to get the
project and the submodules (populated) in one step. If you pass
--recurse-submodules to the git clone command, it will automatically initialize
and update each submodule in the repository, including nested submodules if any
of the submodules in the repository have submodules themselves. You can refer to
the `Git Submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_
documentation for more details.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git

If you already cloned the project and forgot --recurse-submodules, you can
combine the git submodule init and git submodule update steps by running ```git
submodule update --init```. To also initialize, fetch and checkout any nested
submodules, you can use the foolproof ```git submodule update --init
--recursive```.

3. Post-clone setup
===================

.. note::
  :class: margin

  This step needs to be done only once after the project is cloned. It sets up
  the hooks and additional tools needed for commit message linting and automatic
  changelog generation.

Pre-commit (requires python)
----------------------------

Only once, after the project is cloned, do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./init

.. hint::

  This will install the `pre-commit` pip package for python and setup the hooks
  for the project.

Configuring a remote for the fork
---------------------------------

You must configure a remote that points to the upstream `asap` repository in Git
to sync changes made in the original repository with your fork. This also allows
you to sync bug fixes and enhancements you make in your fork with the original
`asap` repository in the form of submitted pull requests.

#. List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ git remote -v
     > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
     > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

2. Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/abdes/asap.git

3. Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ git remote -v
       > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
       > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
       > upstream  https://github.com/abdes/asap.git (fetch)
       > upstream  https://github.com/abdes/asap.git (push)

.. note::

  If your repo is not a fork (i.e. a copy of the original asap repo), you may
  want, in additional to the above steps, to exclude pulling/merging tags from
  the upstream every time you merge changes from it.

  To achieve that, configure the upstream as following:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ git config remote.upstream.tagopt --no-tags

Initial upstream merge (Option 2 only)
--------------------------------------

If you created your repo from the template rather than through a fork, we will
need to manually sync it with the upstream so that later on we can pull updates
when they are made to the upstream.

We'll clear the changelog, then do a first merge, even though the histories are
unrelated.

.. prompt:: bash $

  echo -n > CHANGELOG.md
  standard-version --release-as 0.1.0 --skip.commit --skip.tag
  # Only keep the first 6 lines from the CHANGELOG, the rest
  # is history from the upstream that we don't want in our own
  # log. You can do this manually or using sed.
  sed -i '7,$ d' CHANGELOG.md
  echo "Initial version created from the upstream [asap](https://github.com/abdes/asap) project." >> CHANGELOG.md
  echo "No customizations done yet." >> CHANGELOG.md
  git add .
  git commit -m"chore: prepare for initial version 0.1.0"
  git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release 0.1.0"

From now on, you can easily pull changes from the upstream project as documented
in the :doc:`Get updates <get-updates>` chapter of this book.
