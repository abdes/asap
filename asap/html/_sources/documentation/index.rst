The documentation for the project covers two complementary parts: *APIs* and
*User Manual*.

The APIs are documented inline with the source code comments using the `doxygen
<https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html>`_ style, while the *User Manual*
is written in `restructuredText
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ and uses `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ to generate the final output
(HTML, or other).

The *User Manual* refers to the API documentation generated by *doxygen* and
therefore it is necessary to build the API documentation at least once before
you build the *User Manual* in order to have working links in previews and
generated files.

:doc:`Doxygen <doxygen-doc>`
---------------------------------
*start here to get a quick overview of how API documentation is generated from
the source code using `doxygen`*

:doc:`Sphinx <sphinx-doc>`
---------------------------------
*if you are maintaining parts in the user manual of this project, you should
read this document. It will help you understand how this User Manual is written
and transformed into the final HTML output*
