You chose to get started with `asap` and you made the right choice. This part of
the documentation will help you quickly get started. But before you start, here
are a couple of tips and answers to some frequently asked questions:

#. **What platform can I use to do the development of an `asap` based project?**

   You can clone and use the `asap` project on Windows, macOS and Linux. Most of
   the features will be working just fine but some features may require a
   specific compiler or development tool that is available only on a specific
   operating system.

   There is a recommended setup that is described in detail in the :doc:`Getting
   ready for C++ development <devenv>` document.

#. **What compilers and debuggers can I use?**

   You can use You `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org>`_-based compilers, `Clang
   <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ and `Visual Studio C++ compiler
   <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>`_.

#. **Do I need to install anything in advance?**

   Yes. Refer to :doc:`Getting ready for C++ development <devenv>` document for
   a complete and detailed guide.

#. **Can I use `asap` with my favorite IDE?**

   Definitely. However to get the maximum out of it your IDE should have some
   level of support of and integration with `CMake`.

-------------------------------------------------

*at the minimum you need a terminal program, a C++ compiler and a text editor,
but we're here for maximum productivity and pleasure while coding. Start here to
understand the recommended tooling and the rationale behind some of the
important choices made in `asap`.*

:doc:`Creating the project <get-the-code>`
-------------------------------------------------

*with the development environment in place, you're ready to start working on
your project. Follow this guide to get the `asap` code.*

:doc:`Understanding the project structure <structure>`
------------------------------------------------------

*the project structure follows best practices to implement multi-module projects
that maintain clean dependencies, easily integrate 3rd party libraries and use
cmake in an as simple as possible way. You can learn more about it here.*
